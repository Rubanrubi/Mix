# Mix
Webpack is an incredibly powerful module bundler that prepares your JavaScript and assets for the browser. The only understandable downside is that it requires a bit of a learning curve.  In an effort to flatten that curve, Mix is a thin layer on top of webpack for the rest of us. It exposes a simple, fluent API for dynamically constructing your webpack configuration.  Mix targets the 80% usecase. If, for example, you only care about compiling modern JavaScript and triggering a CSS preprocessor, Mix should be right up your alley. Don't worry about researching the necessary webpack loaders and plugins. Instead, install Mix.
